# SANS Holiday Hack 2018 Writeup

Enclosed is my writeup for the SANS Holiday Hack 2018 (https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2018/). With the exception of one challenge, this hack wasn't particularly tough - mostly because SANS provided pretty obvious hints for each of the challenges. That's not to say I didn't learn anything - most of the challenges were interesting and ventured into topics I don't normally encounter so I ended up learning a good deal.

## The Game

The holiday hack setup is centered around a "convention" titled KringleCon which has talks in different tracks from various SANS instructors, terminal challenges which can be solved with simple one-liners or quick commands, and objectives which scale in difficulty and require a bit of in-depth work.
